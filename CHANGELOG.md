## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Tailnet-only gateway boundary**: requests are only accepted from loopback or the Tailscale
  IPv4 CGNAT range (`100.64.0.0/10`); everything else, including `/v1/*`, gets a JSON 403 that
  preserves the request ID. The configured bind must be a specific IPv4 address (wildcard
  `0.0.0.0` and IPv6 are rejected at validation); oxllm binds the configured address plus
  `127.0.0.1` so local tooling keeps working.
- **Raw config editor endpoints**: `GET /config` serves the exact `config.toml` bytes with
  `${VAR}` placeholders preserved (`Cache-Control: no-store`); `POST /validate` runs the full
  parse → expand → validate → `build_app_state` pipeline in memory as a dry run with zero writes,
  returning diagnostics (TOML line/col when available, marked approximate when expansion shifts
  offsets).
- **Apply pipeline** (`POST /apply`): one shared serialization lock covers HTTP reload, SIGHUP
  reload, and Apply. Apply validates and builds the new state BEFORE any write, then stages the
  new config and the one-generation `config.toml.bak` (exact old bytes, same permissions) in the
  same directory, fsyncs, renames them into place, syncs the parent directory, and publishes the
  prebuilt state. Any pre-commit failure leaves `config.toml`, `.bak`, and the live state
  untouched; a commit or publish failure restores the previous bytes atomically and reports
  rollback failures distinctly. Response lists `restart_required` for startup-bound fields
  (`server.host`, `server.port`, `server.otel_endpoint`).
- **Dashboard configuration editor**: raw TOML textarea with Load, Validate (dry-run), and Apply
  (confirmation dialog, busy-state disable) using safe `textContent` rendering for diagnostics.
- **Weighted virtual-model routing**: Virtual model targets accept a `weight` field (default 1).
  The SWRR algorithm cycles through weighted provider slots, enabling traffic distribution among
  equally‑capable providers (e.g., 3:1 ratio). The dashboard shows each target's share percentage.
- **Per-provider User‑Agent**: Add optional `user_agent` to `[[providers]]` blocks in `config.toml`.
  Sets the `User-Agent` header for chat and embeddings requests to the configured value; the gateway
  passes the configured value verbatim. The value must be a valid HTTP header field value.
- **Per-provider custom headers and extra body parameters**: Add optional `headers` and `extra_body`
  maps to `[[providers]]` blocks in `config.toml`. `headers = { X-TokenTable-Modalities = "text" }`
  appends static headers to upstream requests after gateway-owned headers. `extra_body = { modalities = ["text"] }`
  merges JSON values into the upstream request body before the `model` rewrite. Keys `model` and `stream` are
  reserved for the gateway/client and cannot be overridden. Invalid header names/values and TOML datetimes
  are rejected at validation with clear diagnostics.
- **Provider-model Ping endpoint**: Add `POST /admin/ping` to send one real minimal completion (max_tokens 1)
  through the shared chat-completions attempt path, pinned to a requested provider+model. Returns `{ok, status, latency_ms, error?}`.
  Has exact parity with a normal request: increments counters, feeds circuit-breaker feedback, logs request,
  adds daily tokens, and emits telemetry. Sits behind the tailnet guard and same-origin layer.
- **Dashboard Ping controls**: Each provider row and each model row in the dashboard includes a Ping button.
  Clicking sends the ping and displays the result inline (success with latency or upstream error).

### Security
- **Editor endpoints reject cross-origin browsers**: `GET /config`, `POST /validate`, and
  `POST /apply` reject a present cross-origin `Origin` header (including `null`, malformed, and
  duplicate values); requests without an `Origin` header remain allowed for non-browser clients.
  This blocks browser-based reads/writes of raw config secrets from unrelated web pages; it is
  explicitly NOT authentication — the tailnet boundary is.
- **Strict config schema**: unknown fields are rejected (`deny_unknown_fields`) on server,
  provider, and virtual-model target sections; malformed enabled-provider URLs and invalid bind
  hosts fail validation before the server starts or before Apply writes anything.
- **Body size limit on editor endpoints**: `POST /validate` and `POST /apply` enforce a 1 MiB request body limit with a 413 Payload Too Large response; oversized configs are rejected before any parsing or secret disclosure. The limit is applied via `DefaultBodyLimit` middleware scoped to those routes.

### Changed
- **Reload semantics made explicit**: daily token counters and the last-3 request log persist
  across reload/apply (shared `RuntimeMetrics`); provider request counters, circuit state,
  admin-disabled flags, and SWRR cursors reset on every reload/apply; `server.host`,
  `server.port`, and `server.otel_endpoint` are startup-bound — they save to disk but only take
  effect after a service restart.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **x-request-id correlation fixed**: Request ID is now generated once in the
  middleware and propagated to route handlers via Axum extensions. The response
  header, log lines, and OTel span attribute now carry the same ID, enabling
  end-to-end request tracing.
- **502 fallback returns JSON error format**: The "all providers failed"
  response now uses `json_error_response()` with `{"error": ...}` shape,
  matching the OpenAI error format for the 502 case. Previously it returned
  plain text.
- **`json_error_response` no longer panics**: Changed signature to accept
  `StatusCode` directly instead of `u16`, and handles serialization failure
  gracefully with a plain-text fallback. Eliminates `.expect()` and `.unwrap()`
  in user-facing error paths.
- **Homebrew formula publish fixed**: `publish-homebrew-formula` job now depends
  on `build-global-artifacts` where cargo-dist generates the `.rb` formula file.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **OpenAI-compatible JSON error format**: All error responses (400, 502, 403) now
  return `{"error": {"message": ..., "type": ..., "code": ...}}` with
  `Content-Type: application/json`. Official OpenAI SDKs can parse errors correctly.
- **CORS headers**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all public endpoints
  (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/models`). Enables browser-based
  OpenAI SDKs (JavaScript, Vercel AI SDK) to call the proxy directly.
- **`x-request-id` correlation**: Every response now includes an `oxllm-<hex>`
  `x-request-id` header, visible in both success and error responses. The ID is
  also attached to all log lines and OTel spans (`proxy.request_id` attribute)
  for end-to-end request tracing.
- **Provider status OTel gauge**: `llm_proxy.provider.status` (0=Healthy, 1=Cooldown,
  2=Tripped) now emits on every circuit state transition. Previously the gauge was
  defined but never populated.
- **Unit & integration tests**: 7 new tests covering CORS preflight, JSON error
  format parsing, and `x-request-id` presence on both success and error responses.

### Changed
- `localhost_only` middleware returns JSON error body instead of empty 403.
- CORS layer registered globally, before all per-route middleware.
- All upstream-failure `warn!` log lines now include `request_id` field.

### Documentation
- Added CORS support, `x-request-id`, and JSON error format to README features list.
- Updated architecture doc with CORS subsection, request correlation docs, and
  updated middleware diagram.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-06-01

### Documentation
- Updated `docs/providers.md` to match the actual config.toml — removed Cerebras
  (not in config), updated Groq/SambaNova/OpenRouter model names to verified IDs,
  excluded Gemini 2.5 Pro (paid-only), added second SambaNova tier.
- Updated `docs/architecture.md` with missing endpoints (`/admin/providers/*`,
  `/health`), corrected rate-limit header parsing claim (only `Retry-After`),
  documented v0.1.9 mid-stream feedback deferral, marked root-context-synthesis
  as planned-not-implemented, added `manual_disabled` field to struct diagram,
  and updated admin-route protection to mention dual-stack IPv6 support.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- Hot-reload race: replaced all `.find().unwrap()` calls on provider state lookups
  with graceful `let Some(...) else { continue; }` patterns. Concurrent SIGHUP reloads
  no longer panic when removing an in-flight provider.
- Upstream error body passthrough: when a provider returns a non-2xx status, the
  upstream error message is now captured and included in the final 502 response.
  Clients see actionable errors instead of a generic "all providers failed" message.
- Mid-stream feedback deferred: circuit breaker success feedback for streaming
  chat completions now fires AFTER the stream completes rather than on 200 OK.
  Mid-stream disconnections are counted as failures, preventing broken providers
  from staying marked healthy.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- `oxllm serve` now uses the `host` config field for IPv4 binding instead of
  hardcoding `127.0.0.1`. Set `host = "0.0.0.0"` to accept connections from
  other machines. Admin and status routes remain protected by `localhost_only`
  middleware regardless of bind address.
- `localhost_only` middleware now correctly recognizes IPv4-mapped IPv6
  loopback addresses (`::ffff:127.0.0.0/104`). This fixes CLI `oxllm status`
  failures when the server is bound to a dual-stack `[::]` socket.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- `oxllm --version` now reports the actual crate version from Cargo.toml
  instead of a hardcoded `0.1.0` string (broken since v0.1.5).
  Uses `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` via clap derive.

### Added
- Admin CLI commands now include `oxllm provider list|offline|online|reset`
  for runtime provider management without curl.
- `localhost_only` middleware protects admin/status/health/reload endpoints
  from non-loopback callers (403 Forbidden).


## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- Admin API: `POST /admin/providers/{name}/offline|online|reset` — runtime provider management.
- CLI: `oxllm provider list|offline|online|reset` subcommands — manage providers without curl.
- `oxllm provider list` — condensed provider status table.
- Friendly error messages when server not running (all CLI commands).
- XDG config path support (`~/.config/oxllm/config.toml` with `./config.toml` fallback).
- Provider guide: `docs/providers.md` — free-tier services, model names verified live (2026-05-30).
- Token counting from upstream JSON responses (non-streaming).

### Fixed
- Corrected model names for all 6 providers (verified via each provider's `/v1/models` endpoint).
- Gemini 2.5 Pro excluded (paid-only on free tier, quota = 0).
- Table column widths widened to fit 45-character model names.
- Last Request column width fixed (12 chars).
- Cleaned up debug `println!` statements from error paths.

### Changed
- Model names: updated to verified values (e.g. `llama-4-scout` → `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`).
- Ollama defaults: `granite4:micro` → `granite4.1:3b`.
- Default config searches XDG path before current directory.

### Documentation
- Full README overhaul: binary size, routing algorithm, CLI examples, telemetry section.
- Provider guide with snapshot date and research methodology.
- API endpoint table includes admin routes.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- `oxllm stop` subcommand — gracefully stops the daemon via SIGTERM.
- `oxllm serve -v` / `-vv` — verbosity flags for per-request routing info or full trace.
- `POST /reload` HTTP endpoint — trigger config reload without shell access.
- `bind_family` config option (`"ipv4"`, `"ipv6"`, `"dual"`) — dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 binding.
- Last request time per provider — shown in `/status` and `oxllm status` ("Just now", "5m ago", etc.).
- Virtual model routing table in `/status` — shows each virtual model's fallback chain with per-hop health and counters.
- Circuit transition logging at `info!` level — see when circuits open, close, or rate-limit.

### Changed
- Per-request routing logs demoted from `info!` to `debug!` — default output is now quiet (errors and circuit transitions only). Use `-v` to see routing decisions.
- PID file cleaned up on graceful shutdown.

### Documentation
- Installation section restructured: Homebrew first (easiest), then `cargo install`, then source build.
- Full `oxllm status` output sample in README showing virtual model routing table.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- Local per-provider request/success/token counters visible via `GET /status` and `oxllm status` — no external collector needed.
- `upstream_timeout_secs` config field in `[server]` section (default 5 seconds).
- Multi-tier `config.toml` with `smart`/`basic` virtual models and local Ollama fallback.
- Token counting from upstream JSON responses (non-streaming).
- crates.io publish workflow (tag-triggered, idempotent).

### Fixed
- Removed `println!` debug statements from error paths.
- Removed invalid `crates-io` value from `dist-workspace.toml`.

### Documentation
- Overhauled README with endpoint table, status output example, and quick start guide.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- Proxy no longer crashes at startup when the OTLP collector is unreachable — telemetry exporter failure now logs a `WARN` and falls back to a silent no-op drain loop.
- `base_url` must end with a trailing `/v1/` path so relative URL joins produce correct endpoints (e.g. `http://localhost:11434/v1/` for Ollama).

### Documentation
- Added Ollama local-only example config to README with full self-contained setup instructions.
- Documented `base_url` trailing-slash convention and optional telemetry behaviour.


## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- Calibrated CI coverage thresholds to match actual coverage (workspace 43%, oxllm-core 55%, oxllm 36%) — thresholds now set ~3pp below measured values so regressions are caught without false failures.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- Configured automated security audit compliance scanning in workflows.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- Core OpenAI-compatible chat completions proxy with full SSE streaming support.
- Embeddings proxy route with automatic reactive failover.
- Adaptive Priority Routing Strategy supporting circuit breakers, exponential backoffs, and idle-based decay aging.
- Strict lock-free thundering herd permit shielding using atomic operations.
- POSIX signal SIGHUP reloader watcher to hot-swap configuration on the fly.
- Graceful shutdown logic that drains active streaming clients on SIGINT/SIGTERM.
- Backpressure-safe, bounded OpenTelemetry span and metrics pipeline.
